Equips best Mod of equal or lesser fusion rather than first Mod of equal or lesser fusion.- No longer allow Conclave in Solo mode.- Corpus Tech enemy now gives more XP.- Can no longer deal parry-reflection damage when AFK- Prevent Healing Ancient from emitting healing pulses while ragdolled (pulses would look like they were coming from the wrong spot).- Added more of a visual indicator on Saryn’s Contagion.- Changed Ignis’s default colour to represent realistic fire, not white flames.- Tweaks to Foundry UI sounds.- Small performance improvements to Volt's overload, was creating a lot of particles/unneeded scripts in a single frame- Optimization to use of Runtime Tesselation, objects that were out of sight or in shadow do not need this option. Should improve performance.- Multiple translations added.Fixes:- Fix for Arsenal Weapon accuracy not updating when equipping mods which change accuracy- Fix for issues when players joining sessions from friend list would result in a “double-join”- Fix for damage numbers not being shown on frozen enemies, and damage against frozen enemies not being tracked in stats.- Fix for Ash \"power in use\" bug when using \"Teleport\" on defense target.- Fix for being able to escape Golem boss arena with Loki or Nova when mission is in progress.- Fixes for UI formatting in Turkish language.- Fix for Infested Ancient death burst FX not showing on clients.- Fix for after killing your opponent in a duel, there is a brief moment where you receive a revive context action- Fix for Orthos Prime appearing on Dakra Prime blueprint.- Fix for Conclave team assignment not respecting user choices for teams.- Fix for nodes that did not lead to a proper mission.- Fix for getting stuck in a charge animation if meleeing off an edge/corner/Mount Doom.- Fix for Infested chargers not disintegrating on client.- Fix for enemies disappearing on Client screen when killed by armor piercing damage.- Fixed issues where Vaults would sometimes not appear in Derelicts.- Fix for Lotus Defense mission transmissions not appearing in French, Italian, German, and Spanish.- Multiple Crash and freeze fixes.*This is an accuracy reduction as the projectiles spread further from target."

The Grineer have also learned about the Archwing Technology and they are determined to destroy all traces of it before we find it. To do this, Vay Hek is using Void Keys and Torsion Beam Generators to force open Orokin portals.We must destroy his access to these portals. Our ability to recover Archwing fragments depends on it.Careful, Tenno. Vay Hek is using unstable keys. Cumulative exposure to the keys will have detrimental effects on your health, shields and Warframe abilities. Proceed accordingly.The Lotus- Start the event node on Earth.- Play through the mission, defeat the Grineer bosses and destroy the Void Portal Key.- If you want to take the risk, search out resource caches to find high-value items.- Exposure to the Void Portal will begin to affect you. Exposure weakens your Warframe. The effects are cumulative – the more missions you run, the weaker you become.- Each mission run you will earn 1 Exposure point.- More Exposure points earned = higher Rewards.- Earn 5 Exposure points on a node to unlock a new node.- Nodes to unlock (in order):  Phobos, Ceres, Challenge Node located back on Phobos.- The Challenge Node has no Exposure point cap.

        "changes": "- You can no longer re-purchase reusable recipes that you already own.- Corrupted Mod that had a negative recoil affect has been changed to a \"damage spread increase\"* negative affect to account for 0 recoil weapons not having a negative consequence.- UI tweaks when viewing friend’s profiles.- Minor improvements to usability of Mods and loadouts* Since some Sentinel weapons use pistol Mods, we now perform a check to ensure you aren't using the same mods on your pistol and Sentinel weapon* We now only hide duplicates of level 0 Mods; players may want to pick one level 9 Mod over the other (to avoid the nag screen when exiting the loadout)- Volt's Speed boost won't affect other player's FOV- Changes to logic of Mod “auto-resolve” feature. Equips best Mod of equal or lesser fusion rather than first Mod of equal or lesser fusion.- No longer allow Conclave in Solo mode.- Corpus Tech enemy now gives more XP.- Can no longer deal parry-reflection damage when AFK- Prevent Healing Ancient from emitting healing pulses while ragdolled (pulses would look like they were coming from the wrong spot).- Added more of a visual indicator on Saryn’s Contagion.- Changed Ignis’s default colour to represent realistic fire, not white flames.- Tweaks to Foundry UI sounds.- Small performance improvements to Volt's overload, was creating a lot of particles/unneeded scripts in a single frame- Optimization to use of Runtime Tesselation, objects that were out of sight or in shadow do not need this option. Should improve performance.- Multiple translations added.Fixes:- Fix for Arsenal Weapon accuracy not updating when equipping mods which change accuracy- Fix for issues when players joining sessions from friend list would result in a “double-join”- Fix for damage numbers not being shown on frozen enemies, and damage against frozen enemies not being tracked in stats.- Fix for Ash \"power in use\" bug when using \"Teleport\" on defense target.- Fix for being able to escape Golem boss arena with Loki or Nova when mission is in progress.- Fixes for UI formatting in Turkish language.- Fix for Infested Ancient death burst FX not showing on clients.- Fix for after killing your opponent in a duel, there is a brief moment where you receive a revive context action- Fix for Orthos Prime appearing on Dakra Prime blueprint.- Fix for Conclave team assignment not respecting user choices for teams.- Fix for nodes that did not lead to a proper mission.- Fix for getting stuck in a charge animation if meleeing off an edge/corner/Mount Doom.- Fix for Infested chargers not disintegrating on client.- Fix for enemies disappearing on Client screen when killed by armor piercing damage.- Fixed issues where Vaults would sometimes not appear in Derelicts.- Fix for Lotus Defense mission transmissions not appearing in French, Italian, German, and Spanish.- Multiple Crash and freeze fixes.*This is an accuracy reduction as the projectiles spread further from target."

While the content team was cranking on the next big update our coders (myself included) were chasing crashes and offline contact bugs. Things are starting to calm to a pleasant 'blistering insanity' level of urgency. Here is a list of all the ninja updates we did this week. Can't thank you guys enough for your patience with us as we smash our match-making and chased those loot-devouring crash bugs.-Fixed a long-standing memory corruption bug that was the cause of many random crashes.-Mod drop levels determined by enemy killed not your inventory. No more farming Mercury for level 30 Mods.-Foundry enforced player level requirements. Fix checks for unranked players.-Minimap rendering changed to use navigation mesh. Necessary for upcoming environment. Work-in-progress...-Preliminary in-game update message when updates are pushed (working on getting this to sync better with our CDN).-Hardware failure check to detect problems due to faulty RAM, overclocking instability, heat problems.-Signin rewards UI shows required days to reach tiers.-Added fallbacks when trying to join a session that ends while joining.-Fix chosen Artifacts cards not showing promptly in Front-end.-Fix double cameras after host migration.-Fix crashes in AI and animation.-Fix Corpus laser door networking issues.-Fix over-bloom on characters.-Fix for doors/elevator problems with join-in-progress.-Improvements to prevent accidental selling in Inventory. Work-in-progress...-Fix rockets and redirectional power.-Energy cost changes for Volt and Ash.-Launcher can now resume bulk downloads if the connection to CDN times out.-Fix network problem with other player showing shield > 100%.-Dojo enemies now scale up in level. Work-in-progress...-Fix elemental effects not showing on Scindo, Frago and many crafted Swords and Daggers.-Energy pickups are now shared with other players. More energy in Coop!-Fixes for Volt overload being over-powered, then under-powered. Does radial damage as well.-Fix quit exploits with Alerts.-Fix revive from Pause menu.-Prevent join-in-progress of late-stage missions.-Relax video card restrictions in Launcher.-Fix Artifacts not applying with join-in-progress.-AI will not incorrectly target Turrets anymore.-Update APEX libraries to improve Nvidia PhysX Effects stability.-Add help option for chat commands.-Fix Shotgun Ammo Pack reward being 0.-Fix disarm exploit for some bosses.-Fix for Contacts list not working when you have large number of Contacts/Clan members.-Additional attack animation for Scindo and Frago-Alert enemy levels are now using their region level range.-Stamina Mods for Warframes added.-Fix Corpus Security Cams being alert when they shouldn't. Work-in-progress...-Fix chat window input text being erased as presence changes came in.-Fix Warframe Armor Mods being most common type.-Disabled non-XInput joystick enumeration that was causing instability.-Improvements to 'massive lag' problems caused when a client re-joins a session they had left.-Fix \"too many\" Ancients in some missions.-Fixes to Mod drop levels / rarity.-Crash fixes during update.-Rank exploits fixed.-Fixed a few cases where setting wouldn't save (illegal characters).

This should also fix Ember’s FX, Nova’s helmets, Frost’s jets, Ember Prime’s flaming Mohawk, and the Silva & Aegis.• Fixed Silva & Aegis Codex Diorama not having proper fire effects.• Fixed Sentinel vibrating when riding in an elevator.• Fixed several navigation holes across numerous tilesets, particularly in places where Infested would get stuck.• Fixed for Kubrow pet spawning behind player for intro cinematic when spawning in a mission.• Fixed several issues with controller navigation on Big Picture.• Fixed several localization issues across several languages.• Multiple crash & game freeze fixes.• Fixed opening View Mission Progress while an elevator is moving will cause the camera to stay in one place until View Mission Progress is closed.• Fixed issue with player’s HUDs failing upon reviving.• Fixed Mirage’s Hall of Mirrors not being affected by some mods (Heavy Caliber).• Fixed Clients being stuck on the ‘Please Wait’ spinner when accepting an invite or joining through friends list.• Fixed players being able to invite anyone to Conclave sessions regardless of Conclave ratings.• Fixed issues where Kubrow loyalty would not be restored if the pet interaction did not play.• Fixed issues with stale and latent sessions occurring with Dojo matchmaking when users join rail editing sessions.• Fixed issues in Infested Mobile Defense where the gas that damages the player at the 2nd defense point also damages the objective you must defend.• Fixed issues with the “/invite” not working correctly when doing session checks.• Fixed issues with the Pyra Syandana falling in front of the Warframe when viewed from the back.• Fixed issues with Alert Defense missions on the Galleon tileset spawning multiple Defense targets.• Fixed Extractor counts in the Foundry displays as \"1 owned\" when the player has multiple extractors of that type in their inventory.• Fixed an issue where the player could leave critical actions unbound when changing their key bindings during the tutorial.• Fixed issue when a resource falls into a teleport volume it will remain down where it fell for Clients.• Fixed Helios endlessly rescanning things not in the Codex. Specific examples: void turrets, arc traps, Grineer laser sensors above doors, smashable grates & fans.• Fixed issue with Dex Furis muzzle flash not being customizable.• Fixed issues with consumables purchased through Arsenal not being automatically equipped.• Fixed player completing a Rank Up Test and their Mastery Level will not update right away on the Player's Profile Box at the top of the Pause Menu• Fixed an issue where you could rapidly hit the button to toggle the chat window while transitioning out of any diegetic screen in the Ship UI, and sometimes it would half-open the chat window and leave the screen darkened• Fixed issue if when the player is in the rail management screen, and they press the pause menu button, the pause menu will open behind the rail management screen.

Changing this option now takes effect immediately (ie: no game restart required).- Made all Warframe components sellable (1000 CR each).- Changed Lotus transmissions to reduce chatter: added delay to Mobile Defense reminders, Heavy Unit transmissions now have a 2 minute cool-down and can occur at most 3 times per mission.- Loki’s Invisibility no longer reduces the volume of dialog and music.- Changed logic that determines visual representation of damage mods on continuous-fire weapons (eg: Synapse, Ignis, etc).The frequency of damage numbers used to be limited by using a minimum damage threshold. Since damage mods increase the rate at which damage accumulates, this would cause damage to be inflicted more often though each damage event would not necessarily be larger. This led to people thinking the mods did nothing because they didn't notice the increased rate at which numbers would appear (an easy mistake for low level damage mods). Similarly, headshots would make numbers appear more often but not necessarily create bigger numbers.Now continuous fire weapons now limit the frequency of damage numbers by using a minimum time between impacts, regardless of how much damage has accumulated. This gives us a lot more control and should make things more obvious for players who are applying damage mods (it's easier to notice that numbers are 5% larger in magnitude vs being generated 5% faster)”"

        "fixes": "Some of you may have noticed our change lists from yesterday were incomplete (/sarcasm).While we are apt to make controversial changes in Warframe until the end of time, it is our intention to be upfront about it*. How else would I maintain this supple flame-singed hue? We are formalizing how the changelists are compiled in the future. We will never be perfect, but we can do better.Here is what 7.7.1 has as well as important notes absent from the prior update:-Chat server upgraded to allow moderation, unified authentication and blunt the hacking attempts.-Increased the curve of AI damage/shields for higher level enemies... but then:-After more testing, toned down those same curves for high level enemies (split the difference).-Reduced simultaneous enemy counts when playing Solo.-Restored missing sounds (Hek).-Rollback frame-rate dependency fixes for automatic weapons (too much fallout, but this is fixed properly soon).-Added more blueprints to Alerts (Alt helmets, Weapon skins).-Increase health, shields and regeneration on Cryo-casket in Defense Mode.-Rare Mods are now... rare. Faction drop tables were boosting probabilities past Common in some cases.-Fix gear becoming unequipped after relogin/return from mission.-Fix default Exalibur appearing on title screen.-Removed work-in-progress loadout preset option (incomplete).*-excluding things we want to surprise you with.About turn-around time: We do not have moderation and customer support 24/7. I think it is heading that way, but it's not there yet. Try to temper \"Wtf no dev response!\" with that in mind.About chat: Chat moderation is ad-hoc, but if you're being a jerk we will warn you, kick you, ban you, then suspend your account. Remember the Tenno ways. Humor and Honor are not mutually exclusive.About difficulty: We are planning more difficulty choice to sidestep the Goldilocks problem here. As much as you think the game is too easy or too hard there is always someone who feels the opposite. Internally we felt the early-game was too hard, the end-game a bit too easy. The longer-term fix is to give players choice since one size does not fit all.Next: Bug fixes of course! This goes in tandem with new hotness. In the next few weeks expect tileset expansion, new weapons and more crazy Mods. Update 8 (dramatic cue: \"Rise of the Warlords\") has also begun which will be a leap forward for Warframe and breathe a sense of life and purpose into Warframe Clans.(Also note the absurd number scheme, don't take 7.7.x as 8 being just around the corner... it is not)"

Things are starting to calm to a pleasant 'blistering insanity' level of urgency. Here is a list of all the ninja updates we did this week. Can't thank you guys enough for your patience with us as we smash our match-making and chased those loot-devouring crash bugs.-Fixed a long-standing memory corruption bug that was the cause of many random crashes.-Mod drop levels determined by enemy killed not your inventory.

Work-in-progress...-Fix elemental effects not showing on Scindo, Frago and many crafted Swords and Daggers.-Energy pickups are now shared with other players. More energy in Coop!-Fixes for Volt overload being over-powered, then under-powered. Does radial damage as well.-Fix quit exploits with Alerts.-Fix revive from Pause menu.-Prevent join-in-progress of late-stage missions.-Relax video card restrictions in Launcher.-Fix Artifacts not applying with join-in-progress.-AI will not incorrectly target Turrets anymore.-Update APEX libraries to improve Nvidia PhysX Effects stability.-Add help option for chat commands.-Fix Shotgun Ammo Pack reward being 0.-Fix disarm exploit for some bosses.-Fix for Contacts list not working when you have large number of Contacts/Clan members.-Additional attack animation for Scindo and Frago-Alert enemy levels are now using their region level range.-Stamina Mods for Warframes added.-Fix Corpus Security Cams being alert when they shouldn't. Work-in-progress...-Fix chat window input text being erased as presence changes came in.-Fix Warframe Armor Mods being most common type.-Disabled non-XInput joystick enumeration that was causing instability.-Improvements to 'massive lag' problems caused when a client re-joins a session they had left.-Fix \"too many\" Ancients in some missions.-Fixes to Mod drop levels / rarity.-Crash fixes during update.-Rank exploits fixed.-Fixed a few cases where setting wouldn't save (illegal characters).
