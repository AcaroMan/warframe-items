This should also fix Ember’s FX, Nova’s helmets, Frost’s jets, Ember Prime’s flaming Mohawk, and the Silva & Aegis.• Fixed Silva & Aegis Codex Diorama not having proper fire effects.• Fixed Sentinel vibrating when riding in an elevator.• Fixed several navigation holes across numerous tilesets, particularly in places where Infested would get stuck.• Fixed for Kubrow pet spawning behind player for intro cinematic when spawning in a mission.• Fixed several issues with controller navigation on Big Picture.• Fixed several localization issues across several languages.• Multiple crash & game freeze fixes.• Fixed opening View Mission Progress while an elevator is moving will cause the camera to stay in one place until View Mission Progress is closed.• Fixed issue with player’s HUDs failing upon reviving.• Fixed Mirage’s Hall of Mirrors not being affected by some mods (Heavy Caliber).• Fixed Clients being stuck on the ‘Please Wait’ spinner when accepting an invite or joining through friends list.• Fixed players being able to invite anyone to Conclave sessions regardless of Conclave ratings.• Fixed issues where Kubrow loyalty would not be restored if the pet interaction did not play.• Fixed issues with stale and latent sessions occurring with Dojo matchmaking when users join rail editing sessions.• Fixed issues in Infested Mobile Defense where the gas that damages the player at the 2nd defense point also damages the objective you must defend.• Fixed issues with the “/invite” not working correctly when doing session checks.• Fixed issues with the Pyra Syandana falling in front of the Warframe when viewed from the back.• Fixed issues with Alert Defense missions on the Galleon tileset spawning multiple Defense targets.• Fixed Extractor counts in the Foundry displays as \"1 owned\" when the player has multiple extractors of that type in their inventory.• Fixed an issue where the player could leave critical actions unbound when changing their key bindings during the tutorial.• Fixed issue when a resource falls into a teleport volume it will remain down where it fell for Clients.• Fixed Helios endlessly rescanning things not in the Codex. Specific examples: void turrets, arc traps, Grineer laser sensors above doors, smashable grates & fans.• Fixed issue with Dex Furis muzzle flash not being customizable.• Fixed issues with consumables purchased through Arsenal not being automatically equipped.• Fixed player completing a Rank Up Test and their Mastery Level will not update right away on the Player's Profile Box at the top of the Pause Menu• Fixed an issue where you could rapidly hit the button to toggle the chat window while transitioning out of any diegetic screen in the Ship UI, and sometimes it would half-open the chat window and leave the screen darkened• Fixed issue if when the player is in the rail management screen, and they press the pause menu button, the pause menu will open behind the rail management screen. However once they do this they will be unable to close the pause menu as well be unable to exit the rail management screen.• Fixed issue where Crit damage and Crit chance are not increased by mods for Sentinel weapons.• Fixed issues with overlapping text in solar rail deployments.• Fixed an issue where the player could attempt to bring up the pause menu while viewing any part of the Codex, which led to an inconsistent UI experience.

This should also fix Ember’s FX, Nova’s helmets, Frost’s jets, Ember Prime’s flaming Mohawk, and the Silva & Aegis.• Fixed Silva & Aegis Codex Diorama not having proper fire effects.• Fixed Sentinel vibrating when riding in an elevator.• Fixed several navigation holes across numerous tilesets, particularly in places where Infested would get stuck.• Fixed for Kubrow pet spawning behind player for intro cinematic when spawning in a mission.• Fixed several issues with controller navigation on Big Picture.• Fixed several localization issues across several languages.• Multiple crash & game freeze fixes.• Fixed opening View Mission Progress while an elevator is moving will cause the camera to stay in one place until View Mission Progress is closed.• Fixed issue with player’s HUDs failing upon reviving.• Fixed Mirage’s Hall of Mirrors not being affected by some mods (Heavy Caliber).• Fixed Clients being stuck on the ‘Please Wait’ spinner when accepting an invite or joining through friends list.• Fixed players being able to invite anyone to Conclave sessions regardless of Conclave ratings.• Fixed issues where Kubrow loyalty would not be restored if the pet interaction did not play.• Fixed issues with stale and latent sessions occurring with Dojo matchmaking when users join rail editing sessions.• Fixed issues in Infested Mobile Defense where the gas that damages the player at the 2nd defense point also damages the objective you must defend.• Fixed issues with the “/invite” not working correctly when doing session checks.• Fixed issues with the Pyra Syandana falling in front of the Warframe when viewed from the back.• Fixed issues with Alert Defense missions on the Galleon tileset spawning multiple Defense targets.• Fixed Extractor counts in the Foundry displays as \"1 owned\" when the player has multiple extractors of that type in their inventory.• Fixed an issue where the player could leave critical actions unbound when changing their key bindings during the tutorial.• Fixed issue when a resource falls into a teleport volume it will remain down where it fell for Clients.• Fixed Helios endlessly rescanning things not in the Codex. Specific examples: void turrets, arc traps, Grineer laser sensors above doors, smashable grates & fans.• Fixed issue with Dex Furis muzzle flash not being customizable.• Fixed issues with consumables purchased through Arsenal not being automatically equipped.• Fixed player completing a Rank Up Test and their Mastery Level will not update right away on the Player's Profile Box at the top of the Pause Menu• Fixed an issue where you could rapidly hit the button to toggle the chat window while transitioning out of any diegetic screen in the Ship UI, and sometimes it would half-open the chat window and leave the screen darkened• Fixed issue if when the player is in the rail management screen, and they press the pause menu button, the pause menu will open behind the rail management screen. However once they do this they will be unable to close the pause menu as well be unable to exit the rail management screen.• Fixed issue where Crit damage and Crit chance are not increased by mods for Sentinel weapons.• Fixed issues with overlapping text in solar rail deployments.• Fixed an issue where the player could attempt to bring up the pause menu while viewing any part of the Codex, which led to an inconsistent UI experience. Now attempting to open the pause menu while in the Codex will function the same as if the player wishes to back out of the current screen.• Fixed issue where it would become possible to lose functionality in certain Dark Sector conflict scenarios.• Fixed issue where players could finish the tutorial without gaining any XP in gear causing account issues later on.• Fixed issues with long Kubrow names clipping outside stasis slots.• Fixed rank-up tests being rendered unbeatable if proper loadout isn`t active, no prompts inform user of necessary loadout.• Fixed issue where if a players rejoins a lobby after having previously run out of revives in that same lobby, they will not properly be put into spectator mode and will be have no functionality until the other players complete the mission.• Fixed an issue where the MatchMaking drop down list was still visible in the Clan screen when opened from within the Solar Map (causing duplicate button callouts and leaving no way to change the Clan member list's sort method.)• Fixed Infested Ancients and Grineer Scorpions from using their grapple pull ability on Saryn's Molt avatar and Loki's Decoy avatar as it would not behave well (would have them pause for a few moments, if Molt was used again it would script error and break the enemy). This also fixes a similar issue with Vay Hek’s beam-zap attack.• Fixed issues with Sentinel ‘Weapon Slot’ behavior in Arsenal when switching between Sentinels and Kubrows.• Fixed issues with blank “Trigger” types in the UI for Penta, Castanas and Deconstructor.• Fixed issues with navigating the UI with arrow keys equipping things unintentionally - arrow key navigation in Arsenal has been disabled.• Fixed issue where performing any melee action, then using a context action (Hack Console, Revive Ally), would result in an additional melee action after the context action was complete."
