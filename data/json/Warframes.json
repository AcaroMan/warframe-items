Please be conscious that some areas may appear overly or underlit. We will work to fix up any rough looking spots - feel free to send screenshots are way in bug threads throughout the appropriate subforums.With Inaros, the sands of old have been swept away from U18 Warframe leaving behind a newer, more vibrant U18.5 Warframe. In many respects, 18.5 is a remastered, more HD version of Warframe with months of technical graphical improvements and artistic relighting of many parts of the game (and more to come in subsequent updates). On top of these changes are across the board rendering performance improvements we hope you'll enjoy, keep in mind that your particular hardware may benefit more and benefit less depending on your GPU, resolution and preferred graphics settings.Lighting textures have been reengineered to reduce square compression artifacts and ugly color banding. You may have seen me point this out on past Devstreams.         "

        "changes": "-  Increased stagger threshold and made stagger only occur on big hits instead of on accumulated damage; this should prevent situations where Quick Thinking would save you only to let you get knocked down and killed again.- Changed enemy scaling for Endless Defense missions at high levels (now wave 100 enemies should be  around level 200 instead of 8000).- Removed the Candy Cane Scythe from the store.- Improved Faction invasion momentum by periodically increasing score for leading faction by a small amount (since numerous stalemates have emerged which interfered with the flow of the system).- Implemented Shadow Quality option for DirectX 11; also made it apply in places it did not previously. Changing this option now takes effect immediately (ie: no game restart required).- Made all Warframe components sellable (1000 CR each).- Changed Lotus transmissions to reduce chatter: added delay to Mobile Defense reminders, Heavy Unit transmissions now have a 2 minute cool-down and can occur at most 3 times per mission.- Loki’s Invisibility no longer reduces the volume of dialog and music.- Changed logic that determines visual representation of damage mods on continuous-fire weapons (eg: Synapse, Ignis, etc).The frequency of damage numbers used to be limited by using a minimum damage threshold. Since damage mods increase the rate at which damage accumulates, this would cause damage to be inflicted more often though each damage event would not necessarily be larger. This led to people thinking the mods did nothing because they didn't notice the increased rate at which numbers would appear (an easy mistake for low level damage mods). Similarly, headshots would make numbers appear more often but not necessarily create bigger numbers.Now continuous fire weapons now limit the frequency of damage numbers by using a minimum time between impacts, regardless of how much damage has accumulated. This gives us a lot more control and should make things more obvious for players who are applying damage mods (it's easier to notice that numbers are 5% larger in magnitude vs being generated 5% faster)”"

Changing this option now takes effect immediately (ie: no game restart required).- Made all Warframe components sellable (1000 CR each).- Changed Lotus transmissions to reduce chatter: added delay to Mobile Defense reminders, Heavy Unit transmissions now have a 2 minute cool-down and can occur at most 3 times per mission.- Loki’s Invisibility no longer reduces the volume of dialog and music.- Changed logic that determines visual representation of damage mods on continuous-fire weapons (eg: Synapse, Ignis, etc).The frequency of damage numbers used to be limited by using a minimum damage threshold. Since damage mods increase the rate at which damage accumulates, this would cause damage to be inflicted more often though each damage event would not necessarily be larger. This led to people thinking the mods did nothing because they didn't notice the increased rate at which numbers would appear (an easy mistake for low level damage mods). Similarly, headshots would make numbers appear more often but not necessarily create bigger numbers.Now continuous fire weapons now limit the frequency of damage numbers by using a minimum time between impacts, regardless of how much damage has accumulated. This gives us a lot more control and should make things more obvious for players who are applying damage mods (it's easier to notice that numbers are 5% larger in magnitude vs being generated 5% faster)”"

        "changes": "- You can no longer re-purchase reusable recipes that you already own.- Corrupted Mod that had a negative recoil affect has been changed to a \"damage spread increase\"* negative affect to account for 0 recoil weapons not having a negative consequence.- UI tweaks when viewing friend’s profiles.- Minor improvements to usability of Mods and loadouts* Since some Sentinel weapons use pistol Mods, we now perform a check to ensure you aren't using the same mods on your pistol and Sentinel weapon* We now only hide duplicates of level 0 Mods; players may want to pick one level 9 Mod over the other (to avoid the nag screen when exiting the loadout)- Volt's Speed boost won't affect other player's FOV- Changes to logic of Mod “auto-resolve” feature. Equips best Mod of equal or lesser fusion rather than first Mod of equal or lesser fusion.- No longer allow Conclave in Solo mode.- Corpus Tech enemy now gives more XP.- Can no longer deal parry-reflection damage when AFK- Prevent Healing Ancient from emitting healing pulses while ragdolled (pulses would look like they were coming from the wrong spot).- Added more of a visual indicator on Saryn’s Contagion.- Changed Ignis’s default colour to represent realistic fire, not white flames.- Tweaks to Foundry UI sounds.- Small performance improvements to Volt's overload, was creating a lot of particles/unneeded scripts in a single frame- Optimization to use of Runtime Tesselation, objects that were out of sight or in shadow do not need this option. Should improve performance.- Multiple translations added.Fixes:- Fix for Arsenal Weapon accuracy not updating when equipping mods which change accuracy- Fix for issues when players joining sessions from friend list would result in a “double-join”- Fix for damage numbers not being shown on frozen enemies, and damage against frozen enemies not being tracked in stats.- Fix for Ash \"power in use\" bug when using \"Teleport\" on defense target.- Fix for being able to escape Golem boss arena with Loki or Nova when mission is in progress.- Fixes for UI formatting in Turkish language.- Fix for Infested Ancient death burst FX not showing on clients.- Fix for after killing your opponent in a duel, there is a brief moment where you receive a revive context action- Fix for Orthos Prime appearing on Dakra Prime blueprint.- Fix for Conclave team assignment not respecting user choices for teams.- Fix for nodes that did not lead to a proper mission.- Fix for getting stuck in a charge animation if meleeing off an edge/corner/Mount Doom.- Fix for Infested chargers not disintegrating on client.- Fix for enemies disappearing on Client screen when killed by armor piercing damage.- Fixed issues where Vaults would sometimes not appear in Derelicts.- Fix for Lotus Defense mission transmissions not appearing in French, Italian, German, and Spanish.- Multiple Crash and freeze fixes.*This is an accuracy reduction as the projectiles spread further from target."

Keeping this in mind players can expect future updates to contain adjustments to Limbo, enemies, and interactable elements of the environment, to help make playing Limbo a more consistent experience.  We will continue to monitor Limbo's unique interactive mechanic and its effect on gameplay, and will let you know should any other changes be necessary.
