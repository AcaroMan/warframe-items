Let’s breakdown the nutritional facts here: Arquebex is a very high damage weapon for Voidrig, as it makes sense for his damage output kit. Bonewidow is our Melee Necramech more focused on survivability and endurance. Exalted Ironbride is not going to match 1:1 with Arquebex, but that doesn’t mean Ironbride (or the rest of her kit) should be overshadowed. The below aim to address common Community feedback to provide Bonewidow that extra dash of spice.\nRenamed Bonewidow’s Shield Maiden ‘Shield Bash’ to ‘Maiden’s Kiss’.\nReduced Bonewidow’s Maiden’s Kiss to cost 15 Energy.  \nBonewidow’s Meathook thrown enemies now have 100% Status Chance.\nBonewidow’s Meathook now drains a percent of the target's max Health vs flat damage. When the target is thrown the Damage dealt is a percentage of the target's current Health.\nBonewidow Necramech can now reflect damage while blocking with Shield Maiden (this is exclusive to the player’s version of Bonewidow).\nBonewidow will now absorb enemy attacks for a few seconds after activating Shield Maiden, and the absorbed damage will be added to the shield’s Health.\nEnemy Bonewidow Shield Maiden now has a limited amount of Health and can be destroyed.\nEnemy Bonewidow will no longer reattach her arm while wielding Exalted Ironbride. One thing at a time! \nRemoved Ammo UI when Bonewidow is wielding Ironbride. \nFixed a crash when using Bonewidow’s Meathook on a Deimos Mitosid.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Shield Maiden not deactivating upon Transferring out/back in. This resulted in your shield being on your chest (not active). However, when you pressed Melee you would do Maiden’s Kiss, and it would cost Energy, instead of the normal Necramech unarmed attack.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line affecting Companions/Pets.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line ragdolling you.\nFixed enemy Bonewidow sometimes getting stuck with Ironbride out and being unable to switch back to its gun.\nFixed Bonewidow Melee attacking while using Shield Maiden (Maiden’s Kiss attack) would show Atlas' Landslide ability pop-up text.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Firing Line animation not matching its current shield state correctly. \nFixed Bonewidow’s rear hit box getting hit from front attacks.\nFixed Bonewidow visual-only \"Ability Use Prevented\" problem after toggling Shield Maiden and Ironbride off.\nFixed enemy Bonewidows not knowing how to initiate a Maiden’s Kiss. Pucker up! \nFixed enemy Bonewidows sometimes using incorrect idle animations that would cause their shield to look unequipped when it should be and/or their sword to be held incorrectly.\nFixed enemy Bonewidows periodically playing the Shield Maiden unequip animation during a Melee attack combo.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Shield Maiden not deactivating after redeploying/Transferring in and out but still bashing with Shield instead of normal Melee. This also fixes a related issue where Ironbride would only execute the first attack in its combo chain instead of the full loop. \nFixed an issue with Bonewidow’s Shield Maiden blocking bounds becoming very small when attacked. This was causing Bonewidow to take damage instead of the shield.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Meathook not properly skewering the target if done by a Client player. Previously the ragdoll would appear to float around.\nFixed enemies held by Bonewidow’s Meathook able to cast abilities.\nFixed Bonewidow’s Meathook not displaying \"Not Enough Energy\" UI message.\nFixed enemies on Bonewidows Meathook teleporting to their last known spot instead of just being dropped when activating Shield Maiden at the same time.\nEnemy Necramechs (Voidrig & Bonewidow) will now rotate its body to indicate that it is about to slide towards you. \nFixed cases where both Voidrig and Bonewidow wouldn’t attack with its currently equipped weapon.","fixes":""},{"name":"Deimos: Arcana: Hotfix 29.5.6","date":"2020-12-01T22:31:33Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1238756-deimos-arcana-hotfix-2956/","additions":"","changes":"An important raised issue with Bonewidow is being unable to regenerate Health, as Bonewidow is geared towards the more “tankier” focused Necramech in comparison to Voidrig.

It’s a hefty read below that we appreciate you taking the time to go through. Before you get started, you can look forward to a friendly in-game Inbox message with a few items from us to you. We know you’ve put a lot of time and resources into some of the things we’re changing (Melee, Vauban, Ember, etc), so please enjoy these free items by logging in before December 31st 11:59PM ET:\nThe damage output and charge speed also scale off of one of Ember’s newest abilities...\nTime for a history lesson! Prior to Update 11.5, Ember’s second ability used to be “Overheat”, offering an aura of heat damage which also protected her from enemy fire. Almost SIX years later, it’s time for this ring of fire to come full circle.\nWhen cast, Ember Immolates herself with protective fire armor. Her current level of self-Immolation is indicated by a unique UI indicator; the higher the heat, the more damage resistance, and the more effective Ember’s other abilities become.\nusing Ember’s Fireball or Inferno causes the meter to build faster. But be warned! If the meter reaches maximum, Ember will “overheat” and Immolation will cost progressively more energy per second the longer you stay in an overheated state. To prevent this from happening, use Fire Blast to expel a portion of your heat meter, or toggle Immolation off to reset meter build.\nWith these changes, players will take a more active role in “bringing the heat” to all that stand in their way, with added protection that encapsulates Ember’s volatile nature.\n*Vauban and Ember have been removed from Conclave in the meantime for balancing.","fixes":""},{"name":"Buried Debts: Hotfix 24.5.6","date":"2019-03-26T20:42:29Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1076435-buried-debts-hotfix-2456/","additions":"","changes":"Ember Prime","fixes":""},{"name":"Buried Debts: Hotfix 24.4.4 + 24.4.4.1","date":"2019-03-11T21:01:34Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1069857-buried-debts-hotfix-2444-24441/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed a script error when casting Ember’s Fire Blast ability."},{"name":"Buried Debts: Update 24.4.0","date":"2019-03-08T02:01:23Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1067397-buried-debts-update-2440/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed incorrect FX color on impact when casting Ember’s Fireball ability."},{"name":"Fortuna: Hotfix 24.0.2","date":"2018-11-09T22:23:12Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1027194-fortuna-hotfix-2402/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Ember’s Fireball ability not applying chosen Energy colors. "},{"name":"Chimera: Update 23.10","date":"2018-10-12T13:56:43Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1016610-chimera-update-2310/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Transferring into Operator causing hold Abilities to continue holding until you Transfer back into your Warframe (e.g. Ember Fireball charge)."},{"name":"Mask of the Revenant: Hotfix 23.9.1","date":"2018-09-27T17:23:26Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1012649-mask-of-the-revenant-hotfix-2391/","additions":"","changes":"Updated theme texture icons for all Warframe Skins/Helmets for Ash, Atlas, Banshee, Chroma, Ember and Equinox.","fixes":""},{"name":"Mask of the Revenant: Hotfix 23.8.2","date":"2018-09-19T14:29:43Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1010324-mask-of-the-revenant-hotfix-2382/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Nezha’s Blazing Chakram being blocked by Gara’s Mass Vitrify or Ember’s Fire Blast abilities."},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Hotfix 22.20.7","date":"2018-05-30T19:03:25Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/961879-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-hotfix-22207/","additions":"","changes":"Tweaked the lighting of Ember’s Fireblast ability to reduce visual clutter.","fixes":""},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Update 22.20.0","date":"2018-05-17T14:55:31Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/957066-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-update-22200/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed broken reference to skeletal mesh that no longer existed on Ember’s Vermillion skin. "}],"polarities":["naramon","naramon"],"power":150,"productCategory":"Suits","releaseDate":"2012-10-25","sex":"Female","shield":100,"skipBuildTimePrice":50,"sprint":1.1,"sprintSpeed":1.1,"stamina":3,"tradable":false,"type":"Warframe","uniqueName":"/Lotus/Powersuits/Ember/Ember","wikiaThumbnail":"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/a/a7/EmberNewLook.png/revision/latest?cb=20141124023013","wikiaUrl":"https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Ember"},{"abilities":[{"name":"Fireball","description":"Charge and release a fiery projectile that ignites enemies on contact."},{"name":"Immolation","description":"Protect Ember with flame armor that burns stronger over time, consuming energy once its meter is at full strength.

It’s a hefty read below that we appreciate you taking the time to go through. Before you get started, you can look forward to a friendly in-game Inbox message with a few items from us to you. We know you’ve put a lot of time and resources into some of the things we’re changing (Melee, Vauban, Ember, etc), so please enjoy these free items by logging in before December 31st 11:59PM ET:\nThe damage output and charge speed also scale off of one of Ember’s newest abilities...\nTime for a history lesson! Prior to Update 11.5, Ember’s second ability used to be “Overheat”, offering an aura of heat damage which also protected her from enemy fire. Almost SIX years later, it’s time for this ring of fire to come full circle.\nWhen cast, Ember Immolates herself with protective fire armor. Her current level of self-Immolation is indicated by a unique UI indicator; the higher the heat, the more damage resistance, and the more effective Ember’s other abilities become.\nusing Ember’s Fireball or Inferno causes the meter to build faster. But be warned! If the meter reaches maximum, Ember will “overheat” and Immolation will cost progressively more energy per second the longer you stay in an overheated state. To prevent this from happening, use Fire Blast to expel a portion of your heat meter, or toggle Immolation off to reset meter build.\nWith these changes, players will take a more active role in “bringing the heat” to all that stand in their way, with added protection that encapsulates Ember’s volatile nature.\n*Vauban and Ember have been removed from Conclave in the meantime for balancing.","fixes":""},{"name":"Buried Debts: Hotfix 24.5.6","date":"2019-03-26T20:42:29Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1076435-buried-debts-hotfix-2456/","additions":"","changes":"Ember Prime","fixes":""},{"name":"Buried Debts: Hotfix 24.4.4 + 24.4.4.1","date":"2019-03-11T21:01:34Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1069857-buried-debts-hotfix-2444-24441/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed a script error when casting Ember’s Fire Blast ability."},{"name":"Buried Debts: Update 24.4.0","date":"2019-03-08T02:01:23Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1067397-buried-debts-update-2440/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed incorrect FX color on impact when casting Ember’s Fireball ability."},{"name":"Fortuna: Hotfix 24.0.2","date":"2018-11-09T22:23:12Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1027194-fortuna-hotfix-2402/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Ember’s Fireball ability not applying chosen Energy colors. "},{"name":"Chimera: Update 23.10","date":"2018-10-12T13:56:43Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1016610-chimera-update-2310/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Transferring into Operator causing hold Abilities to continue holding until you Transfer back into your Warframe (e.g. Ember Fireball charge)."},{"name":"Mask of the Revenant: Hotfix 23.9.1","date":"2018-09-27T17:23:26Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1012649-mask-of-the-revenant-hotfix-2391/","additions":"","changes":"Updated theme texture icons for all Warframe Skins/Helmets for Ash, Atlas, Banshee, Chroma, Ember and Equinox.","fixes":""},{"name":"Mask of the Revenant: Hotfix 23.8.2","date":"2018-09-19T14:29:43Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1010324-mask-of-the-revenant-hotfix-2382/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Nezha’s Blazing Chakram being blocked by Gara’s Mass Vitrify or Ember’s Fire Blast abilities."},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Hotfix 22.20.7","date":"2018-05-30T19:03:25Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/961879-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-hotfix-22207/","additions":"","changes":"Tweaked the lighting of Ember’s Fireblast ability to reduce visual clutter.","fixes":""},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Update 22.20.0","date":"2018-05-17T14:55:31Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/957066-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-update-22200/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed broken reference to skeletal mesh that no longer existed on Ember’s Vermillion skin. "}],"polarities":["madurai","vazarin"],"power":150,"productCategory":"Suits","releaseDate":"2013-11-20","sex":"Female","shield":125,"skipBuildTimePrice":50,"sprint":1.1,"sprintSpeed":1.1,"stamina":3,"tradable":false,"type":"Warframe","uniqueName":"/Lotus/Powersuits/Ember/EmberPrime","vaultDate":"2015-10-06","vaulted":true,"wikiaThumbnail":"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/3/39/EmberPrimeNewLook.png/revision/latest?cb=20141124023024","wikiaUrl":"https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Ember%2FPrime"},{"abilities":[{"name":"Metamorphosis","description":"Switch forms, temporarily gaining bonus Shields and Armor in Night-Form, or bonus Damage and Speed in Day-Form."},{"name":"Rest & Rage","description":"In Night-Form, targets are put to sleep.

As detailed here! \n A sharp-eyed Tenno noticed a change with Eclipse's damage bonus using our new Enhanced Graphics engine setting, and it turns out Mirage had us all under an illusion. Eclipse changes its effect intensity based on how bright (or dark) your current location is. The game calculates the brightness by considering all the light sources that are affecting you.  The problem... Under the Enhanced Graphics engine, lighting is handled in a different way than the Classic way we've been using for years. So while playing Landscape missions the sunlight was not being included in the intensity. What looked like bright open ground lit by the sun was, as far as the game is concerned internally, gloomy and overcast. This will be fixed such that the Eclipse ability will consider the real-time sunlight under the Enhanced renderer.

As detailed here! \n A sharp-eyed Tenno noticed a change with Eclipse's damage bonus using our new Enhanced Graphics engine setting, and it turns out Mirage had us all under an illusion. Eclipse changes its effect intensity based on how bright (or dark) your current location is. The game calculates the brightness by considering all the light sources that are affecting you.  The problem... Under the Enhanced Graphics engine, lighting is handled in a different way than the Classic way we've been using for years. So while playing Landscape missions the sunlight was not being included in the intensity. What looked like bright open ground lit by the sun was, as far as the game is concerned internally, gloomy and overcast. This will be fixed such that the Eclipse ability will consider the real-time sunlight under the Enhanced renderer.

When considering Nezha’s revamped kit, he is excellent at mitigating enemy damage \nWith 90% damage resistance, Nezha is still very capable of tanking, but encouraged to rely on his other tools to avoid getting overwhelmed. Taking minimal health damage allows for synergy with Blazing Chakram’s health orbs, not to mention new modding avenues like Equilibrium, Health Conversion and various Arcanes. The change also allows us to improve survivability in other ways, such as the increased health pool, and major Warding Halo quality-of-life buffs listed below.\n(Brief aside: as a Nezha main, I was originally skeptical of the 90% damage resistance change, and I suspect many readers will be skeptical too. However, playing the rework myself quickly changed my mind. The various buffs really outweigh the negatives, making Nezha much more capable in a supporting crowd-controller role. If you doubt just how potent 90% damage resistance can be, try out Gara’s Splinter Storm at 130% or more power strength!)\nOn top of all that, Nezha’s sounds have been remastered, adding new auditory cues for important moments, like Blazing Chakrams returning to the player, or Warding Halos running out of health!\nPlayers will receive a HUD icon indicating the Health of a Safeguard Halo they received from Nezha.\nFixed a crash when casting and teleporting with Nezha’s Blazing Chakram ability.\nFixed a crash when casting Nezha’s Warding Halo ability.\nFixed another crash from casting Nezha’s Warding Halo ability.\nFixed a crash when casting Nezha’s Divine Spears ability."},{"name":"The Sacrifice: Update 23","date":"2018-06-15T00:51:48Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/967249-the-sacrifice-update-23/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Nezha’s Warding Halo damaging ragdolled enemies impaled by Divine Spears at a much higher hit per interval than intended. "},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Hotfix 22.20.5","date":"2018-05-24T19:33:19Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/960082-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-hotfix-22205/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed misspelled text in the Nezha Reaping Chakram Augment."},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Update 22.20.0","date":"2018-05-17T14:55:31Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/957066-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-update-22200/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Nezha’s Halo ring not physically being thrown when equipped with a TennoGen Skin."},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Update 22.19.0","date":"2018-05-02T18:30:06Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/952702-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-update-22190/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Nezha’s Reaping Chakram damage not getting doubled for every enemy hit for Clients."}],"polarities":["vazarin","madurai"],"power":150,"productCategory":"Suits","releaseDate":"2015-12-16","sex":"Male","shield":50,"skipBuildTimePrice":50,"sprint":1.15,"sprintSpeed":1.15,"stamina":3,"tradable":false,"type":"Warframe","uniqueName":"/Lotus/Powersuits/Nezha/Nezha","wikiaThumbnail":"https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/warframe/images/4/45/NezhaNewLook.png/revision/latest?cb=20151217010251","wikiaUrl":"https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/Nezha"},{"abilities":[{"name":"Fire Walker","description":"Blaze a trail of flames, scorching enemies and cleansing allies.

When considering Nezha’s revamped kit, he is excellent at mitigating enemy damage \nWith 90% damage resistance, Nezha is still very capable of tanking, but encouraged to rely on his other tools to avoid getting overwhelmed. Taking minimal health damage allows for synergy with Blazing Chakram’s health orbs, not to mention new modding avenues like Equilibrium, Health Conversion and various Arcanes. The change also allows us to improve survivability in other ways, such as the increased health pool, and major Warding Halo quality-of-life buffs listed below.\n(Brief aside: as a Nezha main, I was originally skeptical of the 90% damage resistance change, and I suspect many readers will be skeptical too. However, playing the rework myself quickly changed my mind. The various buffs really outweigh the negatives, making Nezha much more capable in a supporting crowd-controller role.

However this has a few side effects that impact the game as a whole. First, with more damage, the time to kill on enemies is lowered and the value of Crowd Control declines even more (Vauban?!).

We fixed it by making the vortex spawn a bit above the floor and in the process gave it an FX pass to communicate better what was happening.","fixes":""},{"name":"Nightwave: Prime Vault: Hotfix 30.6.1","date":"2021-08-10T18:03:49Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1276639-nightwave-prime-vault-hotfix-3061/","additions":"","changes":"Rhino Prime, Nyx Prime, Ankyros Prime, Boltor Prime, Hikou Prime, and Scindo Prime Relics have been added to the drop tables!
