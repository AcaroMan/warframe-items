Bows will display a single value, as will the scanner, the former has no magazines and the latter has no ammunition. All other weapons will still show current ammo in weapon/ total ammo in inventory.- Fixed issues where mod fusion could become de-synced or exploited, implemented preventative measures.- Fixed possible errors when accounts are being updated with content.- Fixed issues where some instances of switch teleporting involved attempted melee attempts on the player after the teleport has taken place.- Fixed issue where fusing into an equipped mod would let you exceed mod capacity on a given weapon/Warframe.- Fixed about two dozen Warframe abilities not working in Conclaves/Dojo PVP.- Fixed issues where weapon skins in player’s inventories will show as negative counts in the foundry.- Fixed inconsistencies in the naming conventions for the way Gear and Rank are displayed in the game (UNRANKED vs 0).- Fixed issue with Zephyr’s Turbulence letting most shots through even when maxed and rarely redirecting.- Fixed steam not damaging players in the Forest Defense map as it should – things just got a bit deadlier on that map!- Fixed issue where players would complete missions and not receive any rewards.- Fixed issue where Grineer Commander’s would not move in proper sequence after Switch Teleporting player.- Various Crash fixes."

You may have noticed the inconsistency in Rifted targets ability to interact with hacking panels. While his Rift-based skillset does offer some unique opportunities for players one major issue discussed within the community has been determining what are the 'rules' Limbo's Riftwalking follows. Keeping this in mind players can expect future updates to contain adjustments to Limbo, enemies, and interactable elements of the environment, to help make playing Limbo a more consistent experience.  We will continue to monitor Limbo's unique interactive mechanic and its effect on gameplay, and will let you know should any other changes be necessary. Stay tuned for a Dev Workshop!"

        "fixes": "Hotfix 11.1.2Changes:- A lot of players have expressed that the “15 minute mark” reward tier is often the most desirable for Survival missions. Changes have been made to Survival Reward tiers reward logic to reflect this feedback. We now cycle more efficiently through these tiers to ensure more reward variety.Supplementary info: Before, there would be a limited amount of chances to get rewards within certain tiers as the mission time progressed. Now, with the tier cycling, this means after the 20 minute mark you will have more chances to earn rewards from all tiers.- Changed tooltip “View Warframe Profile” to “Profile”.- Tweaked Contact to delay showing you the in-session icon until the session details are available and you can attempt to join themFixes:- Nyx’s Absorb will now go affect enemies behind walls or cover.- Fixed Nyx’s absorb not doing damage to Infested Crawlers and Chargers.- Fixed issues with whisper awareness while in game. Incoming private messages are now shown in squad chat as well as in their own tab.- Fixed Volt Chassis dropping instead of Volt Chassis Blueprint.- Fixed Grineer sawblade residing in the heads of the Anti Moa. We know the Corpus are trying to save money wherever possible, but their imports of Grineer Parts has caused them much embarrassment.- Fixed Valkyr’s Warcry being permanent on enemies.- Fixed Soul Punch not ragdolling enemies.- Fixed issues with only Hellions and Eviscerators spawning on Phobos Survivals.- Fixed issues where “Ceiling Fish” would occur in Dojo.

Changing this option now takes effect immediately (ie: no game restart required).- Made all Warframe components sellable (1000 CR each).- Changed Lotus transmissions to reduce chatter: added delay to Mobile Defense reminders, Heavy Unit transmissions now have a 2 minute cool-down and can occur at most 3 times per mission.- Loki’s Invisibility no longer reduces the volume of dialog and music.- Changed logic that determines visual representation of damage mods on continuous-fire weapons (eg: Synapse, Ignis, etc).The frequency of damage numbers used to be limited by using a minimum damage threshold. Since damage mods increase the rate at which damage accumulates, this would cause damage to be inflicted more often though each damage event would not necessarily be larger. This led to people thinking the mods did nothing because they didn't notice the increased rate at which numbers would appear (an easy mistake for low level damage mods). Similarly, headshots would make numbers appear more often but not necessarily create bigger numbers.Now continuous fire weapons now limit the frequency of damage numbers by using a minimum time between impacts, regardless of how much damage has accumulated. This gives us a lot more control and should make things more obvious for players who are applying damage mods (it's easier to notice that numbers are 5% larger in magnitude vs being generated 5% faster)”",

If you hadn’t guessed it already, Carrier usage represents almost 80% of the total used Sentinels, and considering we have more than 5 unique choices this needed balancing. Today we're eager to introduce a community driven experiment within the Sentinel class. This is not the final book in this conversation, just the beginning.We've also mentioned Kubrow/Kavat are not off the table. What we want to do is measure. We know where Carrier sits in usage compared to the rest of the options. We want a calculated release of a change that will deliver on giving Sentinels the function of Vacuum, and see how it affects the usage of content in that category. The results are something we'll be sharing as it should be very interesting to everyone invested in this particular topic. The shovel in the ground on this will apply to Sentinels first, but Pets aren't off the table.We're starting with Sentinels to have this contained group of content analyzed. We will be keeping a close eye on how all of you feel about the new vacuum as well as looking at metrics to see how the distribution of sentinel usage changes across the community (right now 80% of you use Carrier)! We will share results along the way as a team, as soon as this Friday on Devstream #81!Carrier’s precept has been automatically changed to Ammo Case - now increases ammunition capacity and converts ammo pickups into ammo for the currently equipped weapon after a short delay.Research it in the Tenno Lab or find it in the Market today!"

If Endo isn’t what you desire most, you can keep your collection on display in your Landing Craft or trade your treasures with other Tenno.Finding Ayatan treasures in regular missions will be rare, but if you’re feeling adventurous, you can speak with Maroo for a special weekly treasure hunt mission that will test your coordination, speed, and mobility. If you enjoy the more leisurely approach to art collecting, you can always have other Tenno do the work for you and acquire your treasure through the trade system. Whatever your method of procurement, once you have a piece of Ayatan treasure, what you do with it will be up to you.- The Void is now an eligible region for Alerts!

After a couple years of talk, we finally were able to set up a Test cluster which could be accessed externally. This Test cluster housed the many iterations of Update 16 content.For 1 week straight leading up to this update, a group of just under 20 veteran Tenno spent hours and hours each day playing together, giving feedback, finding bugs, and voicing concerns. Each day included tireless attempts at the incredibly difficult Raids, hilarious moments competing in PvP, and general exploration of all things new. This past week has been one for the memory books - about 60+ hours together with veteran Tenno who applied their skill to some of our hardest and most surprising content yet. I loved every minute of it, and I can’t wait to see what we can do for quality with the potential that this Test cluster has opened!Rebecca"

        "fixes": "Some of you may have noticed our change lists from yesterday were incomplete (/sarcasm).While we are apt to make controversial changes in Warframe until the end of time, it is our intention to be upfront about it*. How else would I maintain this supple flame-singed hue? We are formalizing how the changelists are compiled in the future. We will never be perfect, but we can do better.Here is what 7.7.1 has as well as important notes absent from the prior update:-Chat server upgraded to allow moderation, unified authentication and blunt the hacking attempts.-Increased the curve of AI damage/shields for higher level enemies... but then:-After more testing, toned down those same curves for high level enemies (split the difference).-Reduced simultaneous enemy counts when playing Solo.-Restored missing sounds (Hek).-Rollback frame-rate dependency fixes for automatic weapons (too much fallout, but this is fixed properly soon).-Added more blueprints to Alerts (Alt helmets, Weapon skins).-Increase health, shields and regeneration on Cryo-casket in Defense Mode.-Rare Mods are now... rare. Faction drop tables were boosting probabilities past Common in some cases.-Fix gear becoming unequipped after relogin/return from mission.-Fix default Exalibur appearing on title screen.-Removed work-in-progress loadout preset option (incomplete).*-excluding things we want to surprise you with.About turn-around time: We do not have moderation and customer support 24/7. I think it is heading that way, but it's not there yet. Try to temper \"Wtf no dev response!\" with that in mind.About chat: Chat moderation is ad-hoc, but if you're being a jerk we will warn you, kick you, ban you, then suspend your account. Remember the Tenno ways. Humor and Honor are not mutually exclusive.About difficulty: We are planning more difficulty choice to sidestep the Goldilocks problem here. As much as you think the game is too easy or too hard there is always someone who feels the opposite. Internally we felt the early-game was too hard, the end-game a bit too easy. The longer-term fix is to give players choice since one size does not fit all.Next: Bug fixes of course! This goes in tandem with new hotness. In the next few weeks expect tileset expansion, new weapons and more crazy Mods. Update 8 (dramatic cue: \"Rise of the Warlords\") has also begun which will be a leap forward for Warframe and breathe a sense of life and purpose into Warframe Clans.(Also note the absurd number scheme, don't take 7.7.x as 8 being just around the corner... it is not)"
