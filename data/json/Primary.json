We now know that more information exists and we must look for it in Orokin Derelicts locked in the Void.Our mission is urgent. The Grineer have also learned about the Archwing Technology and they are determined to destroy all traces of it before we find it. To do this, Vay Hek is using Void Keys and Torsion Beam Generators to force open Orokin portals.We must destroy his access to these portals. Our ability to recover Archwing fragments depends on it.Careful, Tenno. Vay Hek is using unstable keys. Cumulative exposure to the keys will have detrimental effects on your health, shields and Warframe abilities. Proceed accordingly.The Lotus- Start the event node on Earth.- Play through the mission, defeat the Grineer bosses and destroy the Void Portal Key.- If you want to take the risk, search out resource caches to find high-value items.- Exposure to the Void Portal will begin to affect you.

        "fixes": "Some of you may have noticed our change lists from yesterday were incomplete (/sarcasm).While we are apt to make controversial changes in Warframe until the end of time, it is our intention to be upfront about it*. How else would I maintain this supple flame-singed hue? We are formalizing how the changelists are compiled in the future. We will never be perfect, but we can do better.Here is what 7.7.1 has as well as important notes absent from the prior update:-Chat server upgraded to allow moderation, unified authentication and blunt the hacking attempts.-Increased the curve of AI damage/shields for higher level enemies... but then:-After more testing, toned down those same curves for high level enemies (split the difference).-Reduced simultaneous enemy counts when playing Solo.-Restored missing sounds (Hek).-Rollback frame-rate dependency fixes for automatic weapons (too much fallout, but this is fixed properly soon).-Added more blueprints to Alerts (Alt helmets, Weapon skins).-Increase health, shields and regeneration on Cryo-casket in Defense Mode.-Rare Mods are now... rare. Faction drop tables were boosting probabilities past Common in some cases.-Fix gear becoming unequipped after relogin/return from mission.-Fix default Exalibur appearing on title screen.-Removed work-in-progress loadout preset option (incomplete).*-excluding things we want to surprise you with.About turn-around time: We do not have moderation and customer support 24/7. I think it is heading that way, but it's not there yet. Try to temper \"Wtf no dev response!\" with that in mind.About chat: Chat moderation is ad-hoc, but if you're being a jerk we will warn you, kick you, ban you, then suspend your account. Remember the Tenno ways. Humor and Honor are not mutually exclusive.About difficulty: We are planning more difficulty choice to sidestep the Goldilocks problem here. As much as you think the game is too easy or too hard there is always someone who feels the opposite. Internally we felt the early-game was too hard, the end-game a bit too easy. The longer-term fix is to give players choice since one size does not fit all.Next: Bug fixes of course! This goes in tandem with new hotness. In the next few weeks expect tileset expansion, new weapons and more crazy Mods. Update 8 (dramatic cue: \"Rise of the Warlords\") has also begun which will be a leap forward for Warframe and breathe a sense of life and purpose into Warframe Clans.(Also note the absurd number scheme, don't take 7.7.x as 8 being just around the corner... it is not)"

Changing this option now takes effect immediately (ie: no game restart required).- Made all Warframe components sellable (1000 CR each).- Changed Lotus transmissions to reduce chatter: added delay to Mobile Defense reminders, Heavy Unit transmissions now have a 2 minute cool-down and can occur at most 3 times per mission.- Loki’s Invisibility no longer reduces the volume of dialog and music.- Changed logic that determines visual representation of damage mods on continuous-fire weapons (eg: Synapse, Ignis, etc).The frequency of damage numbers used to be limited by using a minimum damage threshold. Since damage mods increase the rate at which damage accumulates, this would cause damage to be inflicted more often though each damage event would not necessarily be larger. This led to people thinking the mods did nothing because they didn't notice the increased rate at which numbers would appear (an easy mistake for low level damage mods). Similarly, headshots would make numbers appear more often but not necessarily create bigger numbers.Now continuous fire weapons now limit the frequency of damage numbers by using a minimum time between impacts, regardless of how much damage has accumulated. This gives us a lot more control and should make things more obvious for players who are applying damage mods (it's easier to notice that numbers are 5% larger in magnitude vs being generated 5% faster)”"

Equips best Mod of equal or lesser fusion rather than first Mod of equal or lesser fusion.- No longer allow Conclave in Solo mode.- Corpus Tech enemy now gives more XP.- Can no longer deal parry-reflection damage when AFK- Prevent Healing Ancient from emitting healing pulses while ragdolled (pulses would look like they were coming from the wrong spot).- Added more of a visual indicator on Saryn’s Contagion.- Changed Ignis’s default colour to represent realistic fire, not white flames.- Tweaks to Foundry UI sounds.- Small performance improvements to Volt's overload, was creating a lot of particles/unneeded scripts in a single frame- Optimization to use of Runtime Tesselation, objects that were out of sight or in shadow do not need this option.

Our weapons manufacturer apologizes for the defective translucency in the 9.5 model.- Fixed rare loss of functionality that could occur when leaving/being disconnected from a session while in the main menu.- Buffs to Orthos Prime, Slightly faster, bit higher base damage. Longer reach.- Fixes for gameplay crashes.- Fixed custom colours not applying to Miter saw blades or boomerang."

This should also fix Ember’s FX, Nova’s helmets, Frost’s jets, Ember Prime’s flaming Mohawk, and the Silva & Aegis.• Fixed Silva & Aegis Codex Diorama not having proper fire effects.• Fixed Sentinel vibrating when riding in an elevator.• Fixed several navigation holes across numerous tilesets, particularly in places where Infested would get stuck.• Fixed for Kubrow pet spawning behind player for intro cinematic when spawning in a mission.• Fixed several issues with controller navigation on Big Picture.• Fixed several localization issues across several languages.• Multiple crash & game freeze fixes.• Fixed opening View Mission Progress while an elevator is moving will cause the camera to stay in one place until View Mission Progress is closed.• Fixed issue with player’s HUDs failing upon reviving.• Fixed Mirage’s Hall of Mirrors not being affected by some mods (Heavy Caliber).• Fixed Clients being stuck on the ‘Please Wait’ spinner when accepting an invite or joining through friends list.• Fixed players being able to invite anyone to Conclave sessions regardless of Conclave ratings.• Fixed issues where Kubrow loyalty would not be restored if the pet interaction did not play.• Fixed issues with stale and latent sessions occurring with Dojo matchmaking when users join rail editing sessions.• Fixed issues in Infested Mobile Defense where the gas that damages the player at the 2nd defense point also damages the objective you must defend.• Fixed issues with the “/invite” not working correctly when doing session checks.• Fixed issues with the Pyra Syandana falling in front of the Warframe when viewed from the back.• Fixed issues with Alert Defense missions on the Galleon tileset spawning multiple Defense targets.• Fixed Extractor counts in the Foundry displays as \"1 owned\" when the player has multiple extractors of that type in their inventory.• Fixed an issue where the player could leave critical actions unbound when changing their key bindings during the tutorial.• Fixed issue when a resource falls into a teleport volume it will remain down where it fell for Clients.• Fixed Helios endlessly rescanning things not in the Codex.

        "changes": "-  Increased stagger threshold and made stagger only occur on big hits instead of on accumulated damage; this should prevent situations where Quick Thinking would save you only to let you get knocked down and killed again.- Changed enemy scaling for Endless Defense missions at high levels (now wave 100 enemies should be  around level 200 instead of 8000).- Removed the Candy Cane Scythe from the store.- Improved Faction invasion momentum by periodically increasing score for leading faction by a small amount (since numerous stalemates have emerged which interfered with the flow of the system).- Implemented Shadow Quality option for DirectX 11; also made it apply in places it did not previously. Changing this option now takes effect immediately (ie: no game restart required).- Made all Warframe components sellable (1000 CR each).- Changed Lotus transmissions to reduce chatter: added delay to Mobile Defense reminders, Heavy Unit transmissions now have a 2 minute cool-down and can occur at most 3 times per mission.- Loki’s Invisibility no longer reduces the volume of dialog and music.- Changed logic that determines visual representation of damage mods on continuous-fire weapons (eg: Synapse, Ignis, etc).The frequency of damage numbers used to be limited by using a minimum damage threshold. Since damage mods increase the rate at which damage accumulates, this would cause damage to be inflicted more often though each damage event would not necessarily be larger. This led to people thinking the mods did nothing because they didn't notice the increased rate at which numbers would appear (an easy mistake for low level damage mods). Similarly, headshots would make numbers appear more often but not necessarily create bigger numbers.Now continuous fire weapons now limit the frequency of damage numbers by using a minimum time between impacts, regardless of how much damage has accumulated. This gives us a lot more control and should make things more obvious for players who are applying damage mods (it's easier to notice that numbers are 5% larger in magnitude vs being generated 5% faster)”"

        "fixes": "- Fixed Latron Wraith and Prime weapons appearing in list of eligible components when crafting the Tiberon rifle.- Fixed intermittent chat server disconnects.- Fixed Grineer Caches appearing in missions on Earth.- Fixed Kubrows performing \"struggle\" attacks on Lephantis.- Fixed clients being able to pause gameplay if they had their matchmaking mode set to Solo and then joined a mission via friends list/invite.- Fixed muzzle flashes not appearing in correct location when aiming through sniper rifle scopes.- Fixed Loki Enigma profile icon packs giving players a Locust Ash profile icon instead – we believe this was an organized prank by our stealthy frames. - - These have now been retroactively fixed in a script. Log out and in to receive please.- FYI confirmed Nova Slipstream has same issue, a script has been run to retroactively fix. Hotfix will come to fix store shortly."
