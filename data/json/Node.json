Dormizones are Host respective, which means that traveling to a Dormizone in a squad will land you in the Host’s. When you are ready to return to missions or decide to leave the Dormizone, then the Host needs to leave to bring the entire squad back to the main floor of the Chrysalith or back to your Orbiters. So bring your friends, Tenno, and unwind in your new home.\n*Unlike the [spoiler] Camp or your Orbiter, the Navigation menu is not available in the Dormizone. However, you can still use the Equipment menu options to access your Arsenal, customize your Operator, or even check your Inventory. This is truly a place where you want to unwind away from the pressures of the Origin System! This is only the beginning of your interactions with the Dormizone, Tenno, more will come in the future.","fixes":""}],"systemIndex":21,"systemName":"Zariman","tradable":false,"type":"Node","uniqueName":"SolNode234"},{"category":"Node","factionIndex":0,"masteryReq":0,"maxEnemyLevel":17,"minEnemyLevel":12,"missionIndex":2,"name":"Draco","nodeType":0,"systemIndex":9,"systemName":"Ceres","tradable":false,"type":"Node","uniqueName":"SolNode146"},{"category":"Node","factionIndex":1,"masteryReq":0,"maxEnemyLevel":5,"minEnemyLevel":3,"missionIndex":1,"name":"E

The key is to catch undamaged fish with the specialized Pulse Spears.\nThere are 13 species of Servofish to be discovered in the various Coolant areas of the Orb Vallis.

Our second world is ready: The Orb Vallis.\nEntering The Orb Vallis requires you to first visit Fortuna, a town full of new characters, new content, and new problems to solve! To do this, you must first reach Venus!\nNew players might only be making their way there now, but with determination and cooperation, you'll master the challenges of the Orb Vallis in no time. We all lift together!\nThe Orb Vallis landscape is so vast in size and discovery that even with the following 20+ pages of notes, this is just the first installment of Fortuna content! You can expect more to come in the next couple of weeks, including more Conservation species, new Operator Amps that will be available for sale from Little Duck’s offerings, and your chance to take down the ultimate threat roaming these terraformed lands. The long awaited Melee 3.0 will also be making its debut in full to accompany the Melee sound additions and changes that were released in Update 23.10.0. A Dev Workshop on the changes will be posted in the future.\nThe best way to catch the robotic 'Servofish' in The Orb Vallis is with The Business' offering of PULSE SPEARS \nYour Ostron Spears will still work in The Orb Vallis, but the fish will be damaged. The key is to catch undamaged fish with the specialized Pulse Spears.\nThere are 13 species of Servofish to be discovered in the various Coolant areas of the Orb Vallis. Some require Baits \nThe Business is equipped with new gear that will allow you to aid in the desperate Conservation effort of The Orb Vallis' wildlife.\nHowzit, glinty? If you’re looking for a new way to traverse the Orb Vallis, the Ventkids have you covered. Hangin’ with their logical fam in the ducts of Fortuna, the Ventkids get by stealing parts from the Corpus and running K-Drive races out on the Vallis.\nno Gilding required! You can earn Affinity for your K-Drive by completing tricks in the Vallis.\nWhile you’re grinding your way through Orb Vallis, keep an eye out for Boon, the leader of the Kubrodon Ventkid Gang, who wants to see if your K-Drive skills are up to snuff. Look for Ventkids Icons on your minimap in the Vallis to find various K-Drive Race courses littered throughout the landscape.\nFive K-Drive race courses will be available each day, but you can replay each race for additional Standing until you meet the Standing cap. For those looking for more passive Standing gain, you will earn extra Ventkids Standing for any tricks you complete in the Vallis upon returning to Fortuna.\nKeep an eye out for floating purple K-Drive Trick Boosters that appear while riding out on the Vallis: hit them for an instant boost to your trick score multiplier!\nYou can also grind on a variety of surfaces in Orb Vallis!\nGaruda can be acquired via Orb Vallis Bounties & the Vox Solaris Quest, or in the Market for Platinum.","fixes":""}],"systemIndex":3,"systemName":"Mars","tradable":false,"type":"Node","uniqueName":"SolNode68"},{"category":"Node","factionIndex":1,"masteryReq":0,"maxEnemyLevel":7,"minEnemyLevel":5,"missionIndex":5,"name":"Venera","nodeType":0,"systemIndex":1,"systemName":"Venus","tradable":false,"type":"Node","uniqueName":"SolNode107"},{"category":"Node","factionIndex":0,"masteryReq":0,"maxEnemyLevel":85,"minEnemyLevel":85,"missionIndex":22,"name":"Vodyanoi","nodeType":0,"systemIndex":11,"systemName":"Sedna","tradable":false,"type":"Node","uniqueName":"SolNode183"},{"category":"Node","factionIndex":2,"masteryReq":0,"maxEnemyLevel":20,"minEnemyLevel":10,"missionIndex":2,"name":"Wahiba","nodeType":4,"systemIndex":3,"systemName":"Mars","tradable":false,"type":"Node","uniqueName":"ClanNode9"},{"category":"Node","drops":[{"chance":0.005,"location":"Aerolyst","rarity":"Common","type":"War Hilt"},{"chance":0.005,"location":"Aerolyst","rarity":"Common","type":"War Blade"},{"chance":0.005,"location":"Conculyst","rarity":"Common","type":"War Hilt"},{"chance":0.005,"location":"Conculyst","rarity":"Common","type":"War Blade"},{"chance":0.005,"location":"Decaying Conculyst","rarity":"Common","type":"War Hilt"},{"chance":0.005,"location":"Decaying Conculyst","rarity":"Common","type":"War Blade"},{"chance":0.005,"location":"Ortholyst","rarity":"Common","type":"War Hilt"},{"chance":0.005,"location":"Ortholyst","rarity":"Common","type":"War Blade"},{"chance":0.005,"location":"Summulyst","rarity":"Common","type":"War Hilt"},{"chance":0.005,"location":"Summulyst","rarity":"Common","type":"War Blade"},{"chance":0.005,"location":"Typholyst","rarity":"Common","type":"War Hilt"},{"chance":0.005,"location":"Typholyst","rarity":"Common","type":"War Blade"},{"chance":0.0277,"location":"Shadow Stalker","rarity":"Rare","type":"War Blueprint"}],"factionIndex":0,"masteryReq":0,"maxEnemyLevel":13,"minEnemyLevel":11,"missionIndex":0,"name":"War","nodeType":0,"patchlogs":[{"name":"Angels of the Zariman: Hotfix 31.5.3","date":"2022-04-29T16:52:16Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1307386-angels-of-the-zariman-hotfix-3153/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed the ‘What’s New’ screen on login kicking players out of The New War quest. \nFixed infinite loading screen during key certain stages of The New War quest. "},{"name":"Angels of the Zariman: Hotfix 31.5.2","date":"2022-04-28T20:22:09Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1306962-angels-of-the-zariman-hotfix-3152/","additions":"","changes":"Also fixes the Laetum clipping through Warfarme when not aiming down sight. ","fixes":"Fixed Cascadia Overcharge description incorrectly stating that it’s a Warframe Arcane, when it is a Secondary Weapon Arcane. \nFixed crash that could occur in post-The New War Plains of Eidolon if a pickup was dropped inside the gate. \nFixed Warframe abilities (notably Rhino’s Iron Skin with the Iron Shrapnel Augment equipped) being activated while using the 1,2,3,4 keys to select Armament Turrets in Void Armageddon missions. "},{"name":"Update 31.5: Angels of the Zariman","date":"2022-04-27T15:02:06Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1305880-update-315-angels-of-the-zariman/","additions":"Added ‘Hair Z’ customization for a Spoiler character from The New War quest.\nAdded ‘The New War Firepower Pack’ to the in-game Market!\nThis pack includes everything a Tenno needs to enter the fray in The New War.

The Dormizone is similar to the Orbiter in that it is your own personal space to customize how you see fit. You can bring your favorite decorations from your Orbiter and outfit this space and give it your own touch.\nVenture into the dark Void of the Zariman with a fully reinforced Arsenal! Unleash electric fury as the newest Warframe, Gyre; unlock a bounty of new Customizations with Voidshell Warframe Skins; and master brand-new Weapons as you bring light to the dark and deadly Zariman.\nGyre Warframe\nThe Ordis Sentinel Skin is available for purchase via the in-game Market if you have completed The New War quest.\nAt its core, Focus aimed to be an exciting new path to enjoy Warframe from the lens of another character. What we’ve come to realize over the many years is that there was a lack of true synergy between Operator and Warframe. We hope to change that while also bringing something fresh to the table!\nFor Operator Gameplay specifically, these changes come in three major ways: first, the introduction of Void Sling; secondly, re-engineering Operators to be Client-authoritative to reduce jank caused by latency issues related to the mission host; thirdly, removal of Void Blast to allow Melee inputs to cause automatic Transference from Operator to Warframe.\nHaving no Melee weapon equipped will result in Transferring to your Warframe holding your Primary/Secondary instead.\nWarframe Melee Finishers can be triggered as Operator with ‘Use’ input near an unaware or stunned enemy, automatically insta-Transferring to Warframe to perform them.\nThe Focus School rework aims to boost the lesser used Schools by a) giving them more interesting and useful abilities, b) defining a clear role and gameplay style for each school, and c) incentivizing Warframe-Operator Transference as part of the core gameplay loop.\n100% Amp Critical Damage for 20s on switching to Operator. 50% Casting Speed on switching to Warframe.\n40% Weapon Efficiency for Operator and Warframe while Void Strike is active.\nSwitching to Warframe after a Chained Sling adds 40% Ability Strength for 20s.\nWhy: Adding the additional Operator Damage allows for benefits for both Warframe and Operator in the name of synergy.\nGain immunity to slow, stagger, and knockdown effects for 40s after Transferring between Operator or Warframe.\nRevive your Warframe by Transferring to Operator and killing enemies before the Revive Meter drains, 15s. Each kill filles the Revive Meter by 30%.\nWarframe is invulnerable for 4s after Operator is downed. Tap X as Operator falls to bring the Warframe to the Operator’s location.\nWhy: Its new coexistence alongside another Focus ability unifies the 2 together to add another layer that benefits both Warframe and Operator. It also removes having to pick up the Unairu Wisp manually, and will instead find you within Affinity Range. \nIncreases Armor for Warframe and Operator by 200.\nWhy: Adding the additional Operator Armor allows for benefits for both Warframe and Operator in the name of synergy.\nPerforming a Slam as Operator switches to Warframe and grants double Combo gain for 20s.\nInitiating a finisher as Operator switches to Warframe, increasing melee Critical chance by 50% for 40s. \nWhen Guardian Shell breaks, Warframe Shield Regeneration rate is increased by 150% and Regeneration Delay is reduced by 90%, for 8s. \nEffect is doubled while controlling your Warframe.\nWhy: Additional benefit between using both Warframe and Operator.\nAdded labels to indicate which abilities affect Warframe and Operator.\nWhile Overguard is active, it will keep Eximus units immune to Warframe crowd control abilities and anything that will stagger, knockdown, stun, mind control, ragdoll, and blind. Additionally, Overguarded enemies will be unaffected by Radiation Status Effects and will be susceptible to a maximum of 4 Cold Status Effects at one time. However, Overguard is particularly susceptible to Void damage (including Xaku’s Xata’s Whisper), which will overall improve the flow and synergy between Warframe and Operator combat flow when engaging with Eximus units. This will encourage you to engage with them more interactively as opposed to easily overpowering them with abilities alone. It should shift the focus of fighting Eximus units to using a mixture of weapons and teamwork, and make Eximus units feel like more of a true threat to Warframes.\nConsidering Eximus enemies are now more formidable, that strength is amplified when encountering Eximus units in a pack. To help counter that in different parts of Warframe we’ve made the following changes: \nWarden Eximus units in Rescue missions have not received these new Eximus upgrades, to ensure they are just as easy to stealthily remove as before.\nAs a follow up to our Necramech Drop Rate & Crafting Cost Changes from Update 30.9.0, we wanted to add another way to set up players for success as they continue their journey to The New War and other content that requires a Necramech to participate. \nRemoved the ‘Craft a Warframe Specter’ from the Europa Junction Task list. \nLike many other areas where you are able to provide a custom message, players can report a Clan ad if it violates any of our Terms of Service, Code of Conduct, or leads to any form of discrimination or harassment of other players. Recruit to your heart’s content, Tenno, but as always we ask that you keep Warframe a welcoming space for all.\nChanged post-New War quest Plains of Eidolon Thumpers to have quest-specific detailing during specific bounties.\nMade optimizations to deleting and saving Warframe loadouts.\nYou can now zoom in and out of your Warframe while customizing their Appearance in the Arsenal! \nSmoothed out the cloth movement sounds on a certain important character in The New War quest that starts with the letter “D”. \nWe have updated certain Warframe abilities to now affect allied NPCs!

Please let all Tenno experience it at their own pace, and be kind. Use liberal spoiler tags if you wish to talk about it, and do not ruin the experience for someone else. Content Creators should clearly label spoiler content and use spoiler-free thumbnails.\nAdditionally, 3 ‘The New War’ Somachord Tones have been added to the post-New War Plains of Eidolon and Orb Vallis.

Due to factors including The New War’s December launch, we have opted to merge this year’s TennoBaum & Star Days together in the month of February.\nFestive accessories from TennoBaum 2020 will return as part of Ticker’s Star Days offerings, and the TennoBaum tradition of donating will continue with a donation to a charity (to be announced on February 9) on behalf of the Warframe community. While no in-game gifting event and online tracker will occur this year, we’ll also be taking the spirit of gift-giving into a special TennoBaum x Star Days livestream on February 10th, which will be our Prime Time gifting spectacular!\nWe rebuilt reflections across the entire game when Enhanced Graphics Engine is enabled to use modern high quality texture format which improves the quality and punch of gold, bronze, chrome, and other metallics.

Many players voiced that the Kuva Lich system got progressively less fun the more time and energy was devoted to it. While finding the line between repetition and progress is one Warframe has struggled with since it’s first day, Liches highlighted some issues we aim to address while walking that line.\nFixed Lich ‘Ruse’ clones displaying the default Excalibur Helmet on their shoulder instead of the same Warframe Helmet as their owner. \nThis fix needs some explanation. First of all, a bit of trivia, Railjack operates at a different scale than the rest of Warframe. Perhaps some of you have seen space-time breaking down in the form of truly enormous cats... The Speed that was being shown in the drydock in your ship Stats was in the wrong scale and gave numbers that were inaccurate.  This also caused the bonus given by your engine, displayed in kilometers-per-hour, to be wrong: an engine might say that it gave an extra 30km per hour, but give far far more than that in the Stats if you did the math to convert.  This has been fixed so that: 1) your Stats now show the correct Speed for Railjack's world scale, and, 2) your engines are rated in meters per second which matches up to the Stats.  While it may look like your ship's Speed stat in the drydock has gone down significantly, please try flying around in missions and see how your ship handles. This only fixes how the UI reports the numbers in your Stats. No change to how fast your ship actually moves is intended, and if your ship doesn't fly at the meters-per-second shown in the Stats then it should be carefully measured and reported as a bug.\nFixed the camera breaking when Warping to another player while in the Archwing Slingshot.","fixes":"Fixed fully default Look Links not applying to your Warframe. \nFixed several potential script errors caused by Warframe abilities.\nFixed numerous script errors when casting certain Warframe abilities."},{"name":"Empyrean: Ivara Prime 27.0.12 + 27.0.12.1","date":"2020-01-23T15:36:07Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1163746-empyrean-ivara-prime-27012-270121/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixes towards pathing issues with the Drone in the Plains of Eidolon. This also fixes a very specific spot where the Drone would regularly get stuck.

With the ambitious goal of telling Warframe’s story in a way we had never done before, The Second Dream started it all. The moments you shared with us while playing through the quest is a memory all of us at Digital Extremes will never forget. So we thought… wow, we did it… Can we do it again? And so it was, we burned heaps of midnight oil to launch The War Within and experience the roller coaster of feels with you all over again.\nWitnessing your reaction to THE SACRIFICE teaser we showed at TennoCon last year is an emotion we can’t quite put into words. We’re pretty sure you guys shook the convention center and the internet. So we’re absolutely ecstatic that you can now continue your journey as Tenno in the Warframe universe in this new quest.\nFrom all of us at Digital Extremes, thank you for sharing Warframe with us. This once small but growing studio in London, Ontario couldn’t have done any of this without your extraordinary support, Tenno.\nWe hope that you have enjoyed the ride so far. We look forward to seeing what Warframe has in store for all of us as we look toward the future.\nNow, a foreboding vision leads the Tenno to hunt for a savage Warframe. Will you unmask the truth in this mind-bending new chapter of the cinematic storyline? THE SACRIFICE will bring you closer to uncovering what has fallen into shadow.\nTHE SACRIFICE Quest is available after completing The Second Dream, The War Within, Chains of Harrow and the Apostasy Prologue, and will be available in your Codex upon login. Bring your best Warframe and Operator loadouts to face the challenges that await you in THE SACRIFICE .\nCurrently, we have exactly 131 screens in Warframe that need an artistic pass to the new style. 8 are done and ready to go \nWe have also have 2 free Themes specifically tailored for our visually impaired and color blind Tenno: the “Equinox Theme” (B&W theme) and the “High Contrast Theme”! We’d love to get your feedback on them so that we can increase Warframe’s accessibility:\nWarframes with unique Ability-driven (Exalted) Weapons can now be separately Modded in your Arsenal! This includes the ability to customize their appearance too!\nAdded the ability to auto-rotate your Warframe in the Arsenal (using the Right Trigger) while browsing item grid. \nFollowing what we started in our previous mainline, we’ve made thousands more micro-optimizations to hundreds of scripts, including Warframe Powers, Precepts, Enemy Logic, Weapon Behaviors, Game-Modes, and the UI.","fixes":"Fixed bad lighting with the giant eye sculpture in The War Within.\nFixed some wonky clipping and holding poses on Warframe Articula when equipped with a Bow. \nFixed selected Warframe Ability resetting to #1 on controllers after loading into a mission or Reviving.\nFixed issue where opening Warframe customization in the Arsenal caused a script error.\nFixed script errors when casting numerous Warframe Abilities. \nFixed Nezha’s Warding Halo damaging ragdolled enemies impaled by Divine Spears at a much higher hit per interval than intended. "},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Hotfix 22.20.9 + 22.20.9.1 + 22.20.9.2","date":"2018-06-07T17:36:27Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/964770-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-hotfix-22209-222091-222092/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed a progression stopper in The War Within where the Operator would lose their Void abilities.\nFixed Operator being \"sheathed\" by your Warframe during a Second Dream cinematic.\nFixed script errors caused by numerous Warframe Abilities."},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Hotfix 22.20.8 + 22.20.8.1","date":"2018-06-05T17:20:04Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/963818-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-hotfix-22208-222081/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed script errors when casting numerous Warframe abilities."},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Hotfix 22.20.7","date":"2018-05-30T19:03:25Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/961879-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-hotfix-22207/","additions":"GPU particle hotness has been added to Volt’s Idle animation as noted here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Warframe/comments/8msg7o/what_happened_to_old_volts_idle_animation_physx/.","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Operator being teleported to your current Warframe position after using the Arsenal on the Orbiter.\nFixed a script error when casting numerous Warframe abilities."},{"name":"Beasts of the Sanctuary: Hotfix 22.20.5","date":"2018-05-24T19:33:19Z","url":"https://forums.warframe.com/topic/960082-beasts-of-the-sanctuary-hotfix-22205/","additions":"","changes":"","fixes":"Fixed Warframe kills not counting towards Onslaught Efficiency when the player is controlling their Operator.\nFixed Despot Syandana and Sovereign Syandana cloth getting caught on numerous Warframes.\nFixed changing a Warframes colours back to default not saving after a mission and reverts back to the colours that were on the Warframe before entering the mission.\nFixed a Venari script error in rare cases where the player's Warframe is not available (ex.
