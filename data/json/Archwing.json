You must investigate.This new quest will be immediately available to any player who has completed Vor’s Prize, and can be accepted directly from the Codex.  It will also be made available to players who skipped Vor’s Prize when the quest system was first implemented, meaning that only players who are yet to complete Vor’s Prize and are brand new to Warframe will need to wait to play!"
